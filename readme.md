# W1D3: Objects

Today we will be learning more about objects. Objects play a huge role on programming and that is why it is so important that we learn it well. Primitive types and data structures are the essential building blocks that will help you build your many awesome projects from now on! 

## Key topics for today
1. Freshing up on Primitive Data Types
2. Introduction to Objects
3. How to access objects' properties (dot and bracket's notation)
4. Looping through objects
5. Using `this` inside Objects

## Important to remember: 

- Every question is welcomed. Remember that your question might not be only yours. By asking your question, you help the group
- To interact, you can either type on the chat or open your mic and talk
- Do not compare your learning process with others. Rather, observe how today you know more than you knew yesterday and create your own baseline
